# Image Captioning Project

In this project, I design and train a CNN-RNN (Convolutional Neural Network - Recurrent Neural Network) model for  automatically generating image captions. The network is trained on the Microsoft Common Objects in COntext [(MS COCO)](http://cocodataset.org/#home) dataset. The image captioning model is displayed below.

### It is the first part part of Model i.e Encoder. It is a CNN Algorithm.
![Decoder](images/decoder.png?raw=true)
### It is second part of Model i.e Decoder. It is a LSTM Algorithm.

### Complete Visualization of how algorithm will work completely.

## Generating Image Captions

Here are some predictions from my model.
